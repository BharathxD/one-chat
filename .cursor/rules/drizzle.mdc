# Drizzle Usage

We use PostgreSQL.

This is how we import prisma in the project:

```typescript
import { db } from "@/utils/db";
```

- **Drizzle ORM Schema Definition**: Define all database tables and their relationships in this file using Drizzle ORM's syntax.
- **Naming Conventions**: Use snake_case for all table and column names.

The schema files are located at: `apps/web/lib/schema/*`.
